## Life With Smart Watch

Good evening, everyone. I'm [@CreatorQsF](https://de-liker.com/about.html).  
I have used Apple Watch 1st gen in April, 2015 and used it for 1 year, while I bought Moto 360 1st gen in January, 2015 and used it with Nexus 5X for 1 year.

Sadly, my iPhone 5s was broken in March, 2016. So since that, I have used 5x as my main machine.

Then, finally, I got iPhone 7 Plus in early December, 2016, and I used Apple Watch with watchOS 3 and iOS 10 as my main setup.

So, now you may understand, there are many experience with smart watch.

## Moto 360

This is one of the most valuable smart watch among Android Wear watchs.  
Of course, if you are rich enough to buy Moto 360 2gen, you should buy that. Because Motorola decided not to roll out any updates about Android Wear 2.x or above to Moto 360 1st gen.

However, Moto 360 can't win first place in smart watches. It's because…

There is…

**Apple Watch**.

## Apple Watch

watchOS 3 is very wearable OS which I was wanting. This is perfect. I can say nothing to complain about this.

Why?

To explain "why", I have to describe the context why I bought Moto 360.

One thing Android wear I can give it prize is one hand operation. You can use gestures to flip notifications.

In Japan, maybe you know, there is terrible rush hour in the morning.  
And it's not rare case people can use only one hand in Japan, this means you can't use your watch on your one wrist with your other hand.

Thus, we could hire Moto 360 as excellent assistant on rush hour trains, and this is the big part of my reason.

The other reason is Google Search.

Siri can't search on Google. Moto 360 can. That's it.

The above is my story.

However, Android wear is terrible about the other parts.

In addition, I realized it's rare I receive important notification on train this time. How many people does get an imperative duty in train to go to one's destination?

Moreover, since I switched to iPhone 7 Plus, I got no low battery notification. So I bring it anywhere, everytime. Therefore there are no needs about Google Search feature on Smart watches.

Since Apple sold Apple Watch, they have considered, due to their thinking concept of less is more. This always happen.

So The Answer Is Clear.

The Winner Is…

**APPLE WATCH!!**

Thank you.
