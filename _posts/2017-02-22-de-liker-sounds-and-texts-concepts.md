title: "de-liKeR's new concept, ”Sounds and Texts.”"
---

Since de-liKeR has been established, its purpose is still "Design", "Link", and "Like".  
To give more description, the name of "de-liKeR" is come from those words.

One point of it is connecting people on the world of design, because I'm wanting to encourage people by trying to combine development and design.

Thanks to others, I could gain sympathy.

But, current situation is so far from the origin.  
Yet, my life purpose is not changed. This change means the second era of de-liKeR is come to achive combining development and design.

So…what is **"Sounds and Texts"**?

## Sounds

What I love now is Podcast. Although it is very popular media in the U.S., but in Japan, it'll be very hard to look for the people who is listening to Podcasts.

And except for Podcast, I'm very interested in Audio, or "Sounds."  
Sounds are lovely. It can encourage people. The part of sounds in the world is huge.

In addition, I will start something related to not design, but Arts. Sounds could be best friend of this activities.

Please wait for at least one year. To explain more, it'll take so much time.

## Texts

On the Internet, "Texts" is the most essential part.  
Despite of this is lightest and oldest media, we could use this for general purposes. And we can usually tell ourselves only by words.

So why don't we focus on texts? Letters have power. This is one of the results of my Design Studies.

And I will create one application. That is communication tool, but not only that. You can also use it as blog drafting, or gathering information tool.

The same as Sounds part, please wait for at least one year. To explain more, it'll take so much time.

## Sounds and Texts

Sound and letters have strong relation, I believe. We can't tell the story of each one without other one.

## Conclusion

Please keep in touch!
