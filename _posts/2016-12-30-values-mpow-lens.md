---

Good evening, I'm [@CreatorQsF](https://de-liker.com/about.html).  
Do you know about Japanese podcast channel, "電気屋Walker" ?

They often talk about camera, smartphone and something new.

And in one of their episode, the wonderful item was introduced.

**Mpow 2in1 clip-on lens**!!

In this episode:

[#012「デカ物スマホレンズ、Mpow 2in1 Clip-on ワイド＆マクロ」 \| 電器屋Walker](http://www.inst-web.com/denkiya_blog/2016/07/18/772)

And this item:

[Amazon \| Mpow 2 in 1 Clip-Onレンズ 広角レンズ（0.6X）+マクロレンズ(10X) 専門カメラ（ネジ直径37mmだけ）/iPhone /アンドロイドなどスマートフォン用 \| スマートフォン用カメラレンズ 通販](https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B019SMM3OG?tag=coffeemaker0d-22&camp=243&creative=1615&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=B019SMM3OG&adid=047HH1370E8GA0C46RQJ&)

So, what is awesome? iPhone 7 plus dual camera isn't good?

No.

Mpow lens doesn't replace smartphone camera. It's alternative way of taking pictures. To expand your range of ways of expression, this can be one of the solutions.

Now let's look at the Mpow lens and review it.

## Unboxing

---

![Mpow box](https://statics-de-liker-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/JiVZd/mpow-box_resized.jpeg)

The box is basically white, and like Apple, has a picture of product at the center.

Box quality is very similar to what of Apple.

![Mpow inside of box](https://statics-de-liker-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/JiVZd/mpow-inside-of-box_resized.jpeg)

Inside the box, we see two items mainly:

- Lens
- Clip

![Mpow all items](https://statics-de-liker-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/JiVZd/mpow-all-items_resized.jpeg)

This is all of what are inside the box.

This is the lens body. What a beautiful thing it is.

Actually, this can be separated to 2 parts. 

If we want to use to shot close things, please use smaller lens.

Or to use as wide angle lens, two parts must be combined(photo shows this mode.)

To separate, turn the joint like a screw.

![Mpow size comparison](https://statics-de-liker-com.global.ssl.fastly.net/images/JiVZd/mpow-how-big_resized.jpeg)

Nope lens is bigger than I thought.

With the comparison between Mpow lens and Nexus 5x, you could find how big it is.

## Shot with Mpow 2in1 lens

Mode: close-up

You may find beautiful bokeh. Can you believe this was taken by iPhone 7 plus?

Although DOF is good for taking pictures of human, not perfect for things.

Mode: close-up
